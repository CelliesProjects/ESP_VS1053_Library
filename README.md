# VS1053

This is a library for the generic **VS1053 Codec Breakout**.
A powerful MP3 / ACC / WMA decoder.

The library is a great base to build your own webradio player.

Designed specifically to work with the **Espressif ESP8266 and ESP32** boards. 

There are currently two methods to program the ESP boards: the ESP-IDF and the ESP8266/ESP32 arduino Core.
The library was created to work with the **arduino Core**.
 
The ESP8266 is the most popular Wi-Fi MCU (know also as ESP12, NodeMCU, WeMos, ...). 
But the library should also work with classic Arduino Uno board too.
